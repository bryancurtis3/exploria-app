      <h3>Our Vision</h3>
      <p>
        Exploria.com is an art-based web application that aims to get people buzzing about art, whether that's in museums, local murals, or art installations. We specialize in the curation of art and manage museums in major cities across the globe. Despite the ongoing pandemic, through Exploria, we wish to revive the spirit of art destination travelling and experiencing new artwork these cities have to offer.

      <h3>For You</h3>
      <p>
        Life in the pandemic has isolated all of us from one another, but we don't want you to keep feeling that way. We designed Exploria to help us connect through our love of art â€” for the feelings, emotions, and stories they tell. Revisit classical exhibits, travel and meet new people, or even grab a few friends and explore art installations locally, whatever your choice, you can find your next art destination with us today.

      <h3>Inspirations</h3>
      <p>
        Our work is inspired by the vibrant colors of the rainbow, the artful crafts of previous and modern-day artists, and the ever-growing world wide web. Some of the websites we imagined our application from are: 
        <a href="https://www.sqwigl.com/">Sqwigl</a>,
        <a href="https://www.jonburgerman.com/"> Jon Burgerman</a>,
        <a href="https://www.equalparts.studio/"> Equal Parts Studio</a>, and 
        <a href="https://www.happysocks.com/gl">Happy Socks</a>.
        We enjoyed the designs from these websites for their nostalgic feel and incorporation of modern day pop art.
